    "The `interrupt_handler` is the core HITL component of our response agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its job is to examine the tool calls that the LLM wants to make and determine which ones need human review before execution. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Selection**: The handler maintains a list of \"HITL tools\" that require human approval:\n",
    "   - `write_email`: Since sending emails has significant external impact\n",
    "   - `schedule_meeting`: Since scheduling meetings affects calendars\n",
    "   - `Question`: Since asking users questions requires direct interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Execution**: Tools not in the HITL list (like `check_calendar_availability`) are executed immediately without interruption. This allows low-risk operations to proceed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Preparation**: For tools requiring review, the handler:\n",
    "   - Retrieves the original email for context\n",
    "   - Formats the tool call details for clear display\n",
    "   - Configures which interaction types are allowed for each tool type\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interrupt Creation**: The handler creates a structured interrupt request with:\n",
    "   - The action name and arguments\n",
    "   - Configuration for allowed interaction types\n",
    "   - A description that includes both the original email and the proposed action\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Processing**: After the interrupt, the handler processes the human response:\n",
    "   - **Accept**: Executes the tool with original arguments\n",
    "   - **Edit**: Updates the tool call with edited arguments and then executes\n",
    "   - **Ignore**: Cancels the tool execution\n",
    "   - **Response**: Records feedback without execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler ensures humans have oversight of all significant actions while allowing routine operations to proceed automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to edit tool arguments (like email content or meeting details) gives users precise control over the assistant's actions.\n",

    "What happened? In our agent loop, we added a simple LangGraph [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/human_in_the_loop/) (see also [how to wait for user input](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input/)), which allows us to pause execution of an agent at a specific point in the code. The interrupt allowed us to pass through the tool call for the user to review!\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see the `action` (tool call name) and `args` (tool call arguments) that we want to interrupt. Now, how do we handle the interrupt? This is where the `Command` interface comes in . [The `Command` object in LangGraph has several powerful capabilities](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/command/). Previously we saw it used to direct the flow of the graph: \n",
    "- `goto`: Specifies which node to route to next\n",
    "- `update`: Modifies the state before continuing execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll use a similar concept to resume the graph from the interrupted state:\n",
    "- `resume` : Provides the value to return from the interrupt call\n",
    "\n",
    "We can return whatever value our graph is designed to handle. In our case, the graph is designed to handle a list of objects with a single key `type` that can be `accept`, `edit`, `ignore`, or `response`. So, we can simply pass `{ type: \"accept\" }` to the resume mechanism in order to tell the graph that we accept the tool call, and that our agent should schedule the meeting and continue on with whatever it's doing."

    "   - The user provides specific preferences (30 minutes instead of 45, and afternoon meetings)\n",
    "   - The agent incorporates this feedback into a revised proposal\n",
    "   - The user then accepts the revised meeting schedule\n",

    "   - The user requests a shorter, less formal email with a specific closing statement\n",
    "   - The agent completely rewrites the email according to this guidance\n",
    "   - The user accepts the new draft\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lastly, we test feedback for questions:\n",
    "   - For the brunch invitation, the user answers the question with additional context\n",
    "   - The agent uses this information to draft an appropriate email response\n",
    "   - The workflow proceeds with the user's input integrated\n",
