    "When building an agent, it's important to consider the information that you want to track over time. LangGraph uses a state object to manage this. For chat history, a common approach is to use a `messages` key in the state, often managed by a reducer like the one provided by `MessagesAnnotation` (which internally uses `messagesStateReducer`). This reducer appends new messages (instances of `BaseMessage` or its subclasses like `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`) to the history and can also handle `RemoveMessage` objects to delete specific messages. This allows for all standard message types to be part of the state. However, LangGraph gives you flexibility to track other information beyond messages. We'll define a custom `State` object (typically using Zod for schema definition in TypeScript) that includes a `messages` key for our chat history (allowing for `BaseMessage` types) and adds a `classification_decision` key:"
