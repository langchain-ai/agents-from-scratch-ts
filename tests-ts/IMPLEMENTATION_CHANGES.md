# Test Suite Implementation Changes

## Overview of Changes

To fix and improve the test suite, we implemented the following changes:

1. **ESM Module Support**: Fixed issues with ESM module imports in Jest tests
2. **Mock Assistant Redesign**: Created a more flexible, configurable mock assistant
3. **Thread-Specific Test States**: Added support for customized test states per thread
4. **Consistent Testing Pattern**: Standardized the test approach across files
5. **Memory Testing Improvements**: Enhanced memory storage and assertion capabilities

## Detailed Changes

### ESM Module Setup

1. Replaced `setup.ts` with `setup.mjs` to use proper ESM syntax
2. Added a TypeScript declaration file `setup.d.ts` for global types
3. Updated Jest configuration to properly handle ESM modules:
   - Used `ts-jest/presets/js-with-ts-esm` preset
   - Added `transformIgnorePatterns` for node_modules
   - Updated `moduleNameMapper` for proper resolution
   - Added `jest-ts-webcompat-resolver` for compatibility

### Mock Assistant Approach

1. Replaced the complex mock implementation with a configurable factory function:
   ```typescript
   createMockAssistant({
     mockResponses?: Record<string, any[]>,
     mockStates?: Record<string, any>
   })
   ```

2. Provided thread-specific responses:
   - Stream responses can be customized per thread
   - Mock states can be defined for each thread ID
   - Default state with basic responses when no custom state is provided

3. Interrupt handling:
   - Added proper interrupt detection using `__interrupt__` property
   - Support for action_request interrupts for HITL flow
   - Automatic continuation after accept/edit/reject commands

### Test Patterns

1. Standardized test structure across files:
   - Initialize assistant with proper configuration
   - Use `collectStream` to gather responses
   - Handle interrupts with appropriate commands
   - Assert on expected behavior

2. Added custom assertions for tool calls:
   - Extract tool calls from message history
   - Compare with expected tool calls
   - Handle missing and extra tool calls

3. Memory testing:
   - Display memory content before and after operations
   - Assert on memory updates based on user feedback
   - Verify memory affects subsequent interactions

## Key Files Modified

1. **Jest Configuration**:
   - `jest.config.js` (root)
   - `tests-ts/jest.config.mjs`

2. **Setup Files**:
   - Added `setup.mjs` and `setup.d.ts`
   - Removed `setup.ts`

3. **Test Files**:
   - `hitl_testing.test.ts`
   - `memory_testing.test.ts`
   - `test_response.test.ts`

4. **Utilities**:
   - Enhanced `tests-ts/utils/test-utils.ts`

## Future Improvements

1. **Type Safety**: Further improve TypeScript types across the test suite
2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for edge cases
3. **Parallel Testing**: Configure Jest for parallel test execution
4. **Snapshot Testing**: Add snapshot tests for response comparison
5. **Test Coverage**: Add coverage reporting for test suite
